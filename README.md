# Learning How to Price Charging in Electric Ride-Hailing Markets

**The 62nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2023)**, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, 13-15 December 2023.

**Abstract:** With the electrification of ride-hailing fleets, there
will be a need to incentivize where and when the ride-hailing
vehicles should charge. In this work, we assume that a central
authority wants to control the distribution of the vehicles and
can do so by selecting charging prices. Since there will likely be
more than one ride-hailing company in the market, we model
the problem as a single-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg
game. The followers, i.e., the companies, compete about the
charging resources under given prices provided by the leader.
We present a learning algorithm based on the concept of
contextual bandits that allows the central authority to find an
efficient pricing strategy. We also show how the exploratory
phase of the learning can be improved if the leader has some
partial knowledge about the companiesâ€™ objective functions.
The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a
simulated case study for the city of Shenzhen, China.
